        <h2 class="header-text">About Me</h2>
        <p>As a new web developer, I've taken a bit of a long, round-about career path. I began as a Business Administration student in college. From there, I moved into a Logistics and Operations position with a robotics company, performing inspection with in the gas and oil industry. From there I moved into mortgages, then as a professional ticket broker. Now, I'm excited to start this new journey as a web developer, perhaps even working for you!</p>

        <p>During my free time, I like to cook, as well as listen to & play music. Some of my favorite cuisines to experiment with are...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cajun - The cuisine I grew up on, and I love discovering new foods from this culture. 
          <li>Latin American (particularly Cuban and Puerto Rican) - My fiancee's background is Cuban and Puerto Rican, so we both like to experiment with recipes in the kitchen. The flavors are relatively new to me, but I've loved everything I've tried so far. 
          <li>Caribbean - I fell in love with Jamaican jerk from the first bite, and I love to find new things to cook with both jerk and curry! 
        </ul>
          
        <p>Both help me to relax and let me "get away", where I oftentimes come up with solutions to work issues out of the blue!:</p>
        
        <p>I'm looking forward to taking the same passion I have for music and cooking and applying those towards a successful and rewarding career.
