        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a new web developer, I've taken a bit of a long, round-about career path. I began as a Business Administration student in college. From there, I moved into a Logistics and Operations position with a robotics company, performing inspection with in the gas and oil industry. From there I moved into mortgages, then as a professional ticket broker. Now, I'm excited to start this new journey as a web developer, perhaps even working for you!</p>

        <p>During my free time, I like to cook, as well as listen to & play music. Both help me to relax and let me "get away", where I oftentimes come up with solutions to work issues out of the blue!:</p>
        
        <p>I'm looking forward to taking the same passion I have for music and cooking and applying those towards a successful and rewarding career.
